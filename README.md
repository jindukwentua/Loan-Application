# Loan-Application
Analyzing the credit-worthiness of a borrower is an essential step in the loan process which has been going on for hundreds of years to varying degrees. Machine learning algorithms can be used to assist institutions in accurately predicting the riskiness of borrowers. We aim to apply a machine learning techniques which will hopefully boost predictive power. The goal of this project is to determine whether a borrower will default on their loan, using both traditional features (salary, level of education, amount in account etc) and non-traditional features that will be used to determine if a loan given to a customer would be performing or non-performing.
